********** Experimental Linux Instructions **********

Requirements:
Ubuntu or other debian based distro. (Unplatform is tested in Ubuntu 15.10 64bit, please give feedback on which versions you test in)
Google Chrome 49+ (preferred). Available here: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/

******************** Installation ********************

1) Download and unzip to location of your choice

2) Open a terminal and navigate to the unzipped folder. 

For example:
    cd Desktop/unplatform_v3.0.0_linux64

3) Give execute permissions to the launcher with the following command:
    chmod +x unplatform_linux64.sh
    chmod +x unplatform/unplatform_linux64
    chmod +x unplatform/unplatform_linux64_worker
    
This only needs to be done once per unzip!

******************** Instructions ********************

Now you may open unplatform in one of two ways.
1) Use the terminal to navigate to the unzipped folder and run the command:
    ./unplatform_linux64_ssl.sh

    OR
    
    Use the file manager to navigate to the unzipped folder and click unplatform_linux64_ssl.sh

2) Unplatform will launch in the background and Google Chrome will open to https://localhost:8888 Refresh if necessary. If Google Chrome does not open, you probably don't have Google Chrome installed. You can try Chromium if Google Chrome does not work. To try it, open Chromium and go to https://localhost:8888

3) If you are prompted about an unsafe connection, click ADVANCED and then PROCEED. See instructions.png for reference. This should only need to be done once.

4) Unplatform will run invisibly while browsing in Google Chrome. To exit unplatform, open the terminal and enter the command:
    pkill unplatform_linux64
    pkill unplatform_linux64_worker
