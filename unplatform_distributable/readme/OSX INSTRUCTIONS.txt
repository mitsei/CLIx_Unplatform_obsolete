********** Experimental OSX Instructions **********

Requirements:
64 bit OSX
Google Chrome 49+

******************** Installation ********************


1) Download and unzip to location of your choice

2) Open a terminal and navigate to the unzipped folder. 

For example:
    cd Desktop/unplatform_v0.4.1_osx


3) Give execute permission to the launcher with the following commands:
    chmod +x unplatform_osx_ssl.sh
''
This only needs to be done once per unzip!


******************** Instructions ********************

1) Use the terminal to navigate to the unzipped folder and run the command:
    ./unplatform_osx_ssl.sh
    
2) Unplatform will launch in the background and Google Chrome will open to https://localhost:8888 Refresh if necessary. If Google Chrome does not open, you probably don't have Google Chrome installed.

3) If you are prompted about an unsafe connection, click ADVANCED and then PROCEED. See instructions.png for reference. This should only need to be done once.

3) Unplatform runs invisibly while browsing in Google Chrome. To shut down unplatform, enter the following command into the terminal:
    pkill unplatform_osx
    pkill unplatform_osx_worker
