<i>Sound of bus stopping at station</i>
<br/><br/>
Bus conductor: This stop is Chotapur! Boy, your father said that you had to get down here.
<br/><br/>
Zo: Oh, okay. I will get my bag and get down from this bus. Thank you, conductor. Bye.
<br/><br/>
<i>Zo gets down from the bus and Kanasu on her cycle comes crashing into him.</i>
<br/><br/>
Zo: <i>(surprised and in pain)</i> Owww! Can’t you see where you are going?
<br/><br/>
Kanasu: <i>(equally surprised)</i> You did not see where you are going! Look at what you have done to my cycle! The handle bar is all bent.
<br/><br/>
Zo: Look at what you have done to me! My elbows are bruised.
<br/><br/>
<i>Sahir sees this scuffle and walks towards them.</i>
<br/><br/>
Sahir: Kanasu, are you okay?
<br/><br/>
Kanasu: I’m not hurt. who's this boy?
<br/><br/>
Sahir: And you, are you fine?
<br/><br/>
Zo: I’m fine. These are just scratches on my elbow.
<br/><br/>
Sahir: <i>(admonishingly)</i> Kanasu, this was your fault. Don’t shout at him for something you know you have done.
<br/><br/>
Kanasu: <i>(sulking)</i> But...! Okay...fine. Yes, it was my fault. I’m sorry.
<br/><br/>
Zo: That’s okay.
<br/><br/>
Sahir: Hi, my name is Sahir. Are you visiting someone here? Can we help you?
<br/><br/>
Zo: Hi, I am Zo. I am waiting for my grandmother to pick me up. I have come from Badapur.
<br/><br/>
Kanasu: And my name is Kanasu. I have heard so much about Badapur. Is it true that they have a computer in the school there? Did you go to school there? Which class are you in? Tell me more about Badapur. Oh! I can see Aunty coming towards us! Hi Aunty!
<br/><br/>
Zo: That’s my Grandma!
<br/><br/>
Grandma: Hi Zo! I’m sorry I am late. I’m getting older by the day and my knees are getting weaker. You have grown at least 2 inches since I last saw you! What happened to your elbows!
<br/><br/>
Zo: I had a small fall but I am fine. But the handlebar of Kanasu’s bicycle is bent.
<br/><br/>
Grandma: I see that you have met Sahir and Kanasu. Zo can help you to fix your cycle, Kanasu. Will the two of you come home with Zo and me for a while?
<br/><br/>
Sahir: Thank you Aunty. That’s a good idea. Come, Zo, let me help you carry that bag. Kanasu, you can walk with the cycle.
<br/><br/>
Kanasu: You can put the other bag on the cycle, Zo. Let’s go!
