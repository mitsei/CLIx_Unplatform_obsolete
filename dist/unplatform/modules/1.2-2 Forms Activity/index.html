<p style="font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">
A young girl, Sara Kimberly, has just joined 11th Standard. She has to fill a form to complete the registration formalities. She wished her father, John David Matthews were here to help her, but he had to go away to work since he was the Manager in the SBI Bank. He had recently been transferred and she liked her new home 10-A on the second floor of Lakeview Residency Apartments in Airali Lane. It was very similar to their house in their hometown. The addresses were similar too. 10-A, 1st floor, Lakepoint Towers, Choirue Lane, Saidapet, Chennai - 600021. The new house was in Chorus Lane, Patna, Bihar - 800012. Her mother, Lynnette Rachel, and her sister, Grace Janet, had also not come to school becuase they said they had work. She was sure they were organising a ""surprise"" birthday party for Sara which was on 15 July when she would turn 16. She was called the millenial child since she was born in 2000. She wondered if they would write her name in Malayalam even though she could not read her mother tongue.
