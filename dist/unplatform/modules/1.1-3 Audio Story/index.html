<i>Sound of bus stopping at station.</i></br>
Bus conductor: This stop is Chotapur! Boy, your father said that you had to get down here.
</br></br>
Zo: Oh, okay. I will get my bag and get down from this bus. Thank you, Conductor. Bye. </br>
<i>Zo gets down from the bus and Kanasu on her cycle comes crashing into him.</i>
</br></br>
Zo: <i>(surprised and in pain)</i> Owww! Can't you see where you are going?
</br></br>
Kanasu: <i>(equally surprised)</i>  You did not see where you are going! Look at what you have done to my cycle! The handle bar is all bent.
</br></br>
Zo: Look at what you have done to me! My elbows are bruised.
</br></br>
<i>Manu sees this scuffle and walks towards them. </i>
</br></br>
Manu: Kanasu, are you okay? 
</br></br>
Kanasu: I'm not hurt. who is this boy?
</br></br>
Manu: And you, are you fine? 
</br></br>
Zo: I am fine. These are just scratches on my elbow. 
</br></br>
Manu: <i>(admonishingly)</i> Kanasu, this was your fault. Don't shout at him for something you know you have done. 
</br></br>
Kanasu: <i>(sulking)</i> But...! Okay...fine. Yes, it was my fault. I am sorry.
</br></br>
Zo: That's okay. 
</br></br>
Manu: Hi, my name is Manu. Are you visiting someone here? Can we help you?
</br></br>
Zo: Hi, I am Zo. I am waiting for my grandmother to pick me up. I have come from Badapur. 
</br></br>
Kanasu: And my name is Kanasu. I have heard so much about Badapur. Is it true that they have computers in the school there? Did you go to school there? Which class are you in? Tell me more about Badapur. Oh! I can see Aunty coming towards us! Hi Aunty! 
</br></br>
Zo: That is my Grandma! 
</br></br>
Grandma: Hi Zo! I'm sorry I am late. I'm getting older by the day and my knees are getting weaker. You have grown at least 2 inches since I last saw you! What happened to your elbows! 
</br></br>
Zo: I had a small fall but I am fine. But the handlebar of Kanasu's bicycle is bent.
</br></br>
Grandma: I see that you have met Manu and Kanasu. Zo can help you to fix your cycle, Kanasu. Will the two of you come home with Zo and me for a while?
</br></br>
Manu: Sure, Aunty. That is a good idea. Come, Zo, let me help you carry that bag. Kanasu, you can walk with the cycle.
</br></br>
Kanasu: You can put the other bag on the cycle, Zo. Let's go!
